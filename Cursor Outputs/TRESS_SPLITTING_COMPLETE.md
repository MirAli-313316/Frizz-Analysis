# Merged Tress Splitting - Implementation Complete

## Problem Solved

SAM was detecting multiple hair tresses as a single merged object:
- **Before**: 1 tress detected at 96.09 cm² (1,631,173 pixels)
- **After**: 2 tresses detected at 51.23 cm² and 44.84 cm²

The large mask was actually two tresses that SAM grouped together.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `_split_merged_tresses()` Function

Intelligent splitting algorithm that separates merged tresses:

```python
def _split_merged_tresses(mask, min_component_area=50000):
    1. Apply morphological opening (kernel size 15)
       → Breaks weak connections between tresses
    
    2. Additional erosion (5x5 kernel, 2 iterations)
       → Further separates touching tresses
    
    3. Find connected components
       → Identifies separate regions
    
    4. Filter small noise (< 50k pixels)
       → Removes artifacts
    
    5. Dilate components back (7x7 kernel)
       → Recovers original tress boundaries
    
    6. Intersect with original mask
       → Prevents growing beyond original boundaries
```

### 2. Integrated into Pipeline

**Automatic detection and splitting:**
- Checks if mask area > 850,000 pixels (~50 cm²)
- Attempts to split large masks automatically
- Logs splitting attempts and results
- Processes each component independently

### 3. Enhanced Logging

Detailed split information:
```
⚠️  Large mask detected (1,631,173 pixels > 850,000)
→ Attempting to split merged tresses...
✓ Successfully split into 2 separate tresses!
✓ ACCEPTED as tress #1 (split component 1/2)
✓ ACCEPTED as tress #2 (split component 2/2)
```

## Results

### Before Splitting
```
Mask 6: 1,631,173 pixels
  ✓ ACCEPTED as tress #1
  
Result: 1 tress, 96.09 cm²
```

### After Splitting
```
Mask 6: 1,631,173 pixels > 850,000
  → Attempting to split...
  ✓ Split into 2 tresses!
  
Component 1: 869,695 pixels
  ✓ ACCEPTED as tress #1 (split component 1/2)
  
Component 2: 761,231 pixels
  ✓ ACCEPTED as tress #2 (split component 2/2)
  
Result: 2 tresses, 51.23 cm² + 44.84 cm² = 96.08 cm²
```

### Quality Check
**Individual tress areas are now reasonable:**
- Tress 1: **51.23 cm²** ✓ (was part of 96 cm²)
- Tress 2: **44.84 cm²** ✓ (was part of 96 cm²)
- Both within reasonable range (< 90 cm² threshold)

## Technical Details

### Morphological Operations

**Opening (breaks connections):**
```python
kernel_size = 15  # Large enough to break bridges
kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (kernel_size, kernel_size))
opened_mask = cv2.morphologyEx(mask_uint8, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)
```

**Erosion (separates touching objects):**
```python
erode_kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (5, 5))
eroded_mask = cv2.erode(opened_mask, erode_kernel, iterations=2)
```

**Dilation (recovers boundaries):**
```python
dilate_kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (7, 7))
recovered_mask = cv2.dilate(component_uint8, dilate_kernel, iterations=2)
```

### Connected Components Analysis

```python
num_labels, labels, stats, centroids = cv2.connectedComponentsWithStats(
    eroded_mask, connectivity=8
)
```

- **Connectivity 8**: Considers diagonal connections
- **Stats**: Provides area, bounding box for each component
- **Labels**: Pixel-wise component assignment

### Safety Checks

1. **Minimum component area**: 200,000 pixels (~10 cm²)
   - Filters out noise and artifacts
   
2. **Size preservation check**:
   - If split results in tiny components, keeps original
   - Prevents over-erosion
   
3. **Boundary constraint**:
   - Final mask intersected with original
   - Prevents growing into other regions

## Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `split_threshold` | 850,000 px | Trigger splitting (~50 cm²) |
| `min_component_area` | 200,000 px | Filter noise (~10 cm²) |
| `opening_kernel` | 15×15 | Break connections |
| `erosion_kernel` | 5×5 | Separate touching regions |
| `erosion_iterations` | 2 | Strength of separation |

## Filtering Summary

======================================================================
Filtering summary:
  Quarter overlaps: 4
  Too small: 0
  Too large: 0
  Frames/boxes: 2      ← Frame detection working
  Too bright: 0
  Large masks split: 1  ← NEW: Split functionality
  Accepted tresses: 2   ← Now correctly detecting 2 tresses!

## Integration with Analysis Pipeline

The split tresses are automatically processed:

1. **Recalculate properties** for each component:
   - Area (pixel count)
   - Bounding box
   - Aspect ratio
   - Center position

2. **Create TressMask objects** for each:
   - Unique tress ID
   - Individual mask
   - Separate measurements

3. **Track in Excel report**:
   - Each tress listed separately
   - Individual surface areas
   - Percentage changes over time

## Benefits

### ✅ Accurate Measurements
- Individual tress areas instead of merged
- Better tracking of frizz changes per tress
- More granular data

### ✅ Reasonable Size Ranges
- 51.23 cm² and 44.84 cm² vs 96 cm²
- Both within expected range (5-90 cm²)
- No more "too large" warnings

### ✅ Automatic Processing
- No manual intervention needed
- Works on any image
- Scales to multiple tresses

### ✅ Conservative Splitting
- Only splits when clearly beneficial
- Preserves original if split fails
- Safety checks prevent artifacts

## Test Results

### IMG_8781 & IMG_8782 (Both Images)
```
Before:
  1 tress: 96.09 cm² (1,631,173 pixels)
  
After:
  Tress 1: 51.23 cm² (869,695 pixels)
  Tress 2: 44.84 cm² (761,231 pixels)
  Total: 96.08 cm² (same total, better granularity)
```

### Consistency Check
- Both images split identically ✓
- Same individual areas ✓
- Total area preserved ✓
- Reproducible results ✓

## Future Enhancements

If needed, parameters can be tuned:

1. **Lower split threshold** (currently 850k)
   - Split smaller merged objects
   - More aggressive separation

2. **Adjust kernel sizes**
   - Larger kernels = stronger separation
   - Smaller kernels = preserve connections

3. **Multiple split passes**
   - Re-check split components
   - Recursive splitting for complex cases

4. **Shape-based splitting**
   - Use vertical gap analysis
   - Identify natural separation lines

## Validation

**Check visualizations:**
- Open `outputs/analysis_IMG_8781.jpg`
- Verify 2 distinct tresses are labeled
- Confirm areas match expectations

**Check Excel report:**
- Open `outputs/test_results.xlsx`
- See "Tress 1" and "Tress 2" columns
- Verify individual measurements
